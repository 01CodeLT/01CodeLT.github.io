            <p>I'm a Software Developer in the North West of England. I have around 10 years of experience developing websites (both front and backend), primarily using PHP, NodeJS or Python.</p>
            <p>My work has often lead me down all sorts of paths, just some of the things Iâ€™ve dabbled in include: Data Mining, Geospatial Data Analysis, Cloud Architecture, PC Applications and Arduino.</p>

                        <b>Web Development - Freelance</b>
                        <p>During this period I worked on a variety of PHP & Wordpress projects, which included the development of a Mobile App for a construction company and a racing car licensing system built with PHP CodeIgniter.</p>

                        <b>Software Developer - Offigo</b>
                        <p>When I started at this position the company had a Wordpress Site to which I made a number of customisations, I also developed a Mobile App with Ionic which sourced data from the site.</p>
                        <p>After some time there became a need for the company to expand and build a bespoke version of the system which I designed and developed using Angular & Laravel. Version 2 of the website and app included a: CMS, Hootsuite style social media scheduler, Stripe subscription system and an Address lookup system using data from Ordnance Survey.</p>

                        <p>Much of my previous experience has often involved streamlining existing software and improving security, lowering costs as well as making some real improvements from a UX perspective. I'm currently begninning to use this experience to consult with businesses and make the same kind of improvements I've made in the past, long term I'm looking to do this on a permanent basis.
